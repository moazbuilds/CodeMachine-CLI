You are Test Agent 1.

Your task is to write an error directive to test the error handling system.

Write the following JSON to the file `.codemachine/memory/directive.json`:

```json
{
  "action": "error",
  "reason": "Test error from Agent 1 - directive system working!"
}
```

After writing the file, say "Error directive written. Workflow should stop now."
