# Step 6: Project-Type Deep Dive

**Progress: Step 6 of 10** - Next: MVP Scoping

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input

- ✅ ALWAYS treat this as collaborative discovery between PM peers
- 📋 YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- 💬 FOCUS on project-type specific requirements and technical considerations
- 🎯 DATA-DRIVEN: Use CSV configuration to guide discovery

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Show your analysis before taking any action

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Current document and frontmatter from previous steps are available
- Project type from step-01 is available for configuration loading
- Project-type CSV data (project-types.csv) already loaded in workflow context
- Focus on technical and functional requirements specific to this project type

## YOUR TASK:

Conduct project-type specific discovery using CSV-driven guidance to define technical requirements.

## PROJECT-TYPE DISCOVERY SEQUENCE:

### 1. Use Project-Type Configuration Data

Use project-type specific configuration from workflow context:

- Find the row in project-types data where `project_type` matches detected type from step-01
- Extract these columns:
  - `key_questions` (semicolon-separated list of discovery questions)
  - `required_sections` (semicolon-separated list of sections to document)
  - `skip_sections` (semicolon-separated list of sections to skip)
  - `innovation_signals` (already explored in step-5)

### 2. Conduct Guided Discovery Using Key Questions

Parse `key_questions` from CSV and explore each:

#### Question-Based Discovery:

For each question in `key_questions` from CSV:

- Ask the user naturally in conversational style
- Listen for their response and ask clarifying follow-ups
- Connect answers to product value proposition

**Example Flow:**
If key_questions = "Endpoints needed?;Authentication method?;Data formats?;Rate limits?;Versioning?;SDK needed?"

Ask naturally:

- "What are the main endpoints your API needs to expose?"
- "How will you handle authentication and authorization?"
- "What data formats will you support for requests and responses?"

### 3. Document Project-Type Specific Requirements

Based on user answers to key_questions, synthesize comprehensive requirements:

#### Requirement Categories:

Cover the areas indicated by `required_sections` from CSV:

- Synthesize what was discovered for each required section
- Document specific requirements, constraints, and decisions
- Connect to product differentiator when relevant

#### Skip Irrelevant Sections:

Skip areas indicated by `skip_sections` from CSV to avoid wasting time on irrelevant aspects.

### 4. Generate Dynamic Content Sections

Parse `required_sections` list from the matched CSV row. For each section name, generate corresponding content:

#### Common CSV Section Mappings:

- "endpoint_specs" or "endpoint_specification" → API endpoints documentation
- "auth_model" or "authentication_model" → Authentication approach
- "platform_reqs" or "platform_requirements" → Platform support needs
- "device_permissions" or "device_features" → Device capabilities
- "tenant_model" → Multi-tenancy approach
- "rbac_matrix" or "permission_matrix" → Permission structure

#### Template Variable Strategy:

- For sections matching common template variables: generate specific content
- For sections without template matches: include in main project_type_requirements
- Hybrid approach balances template structure with CSV-driven flexibility

### 5. Generate Project-Type Content

Prepare the content to append to the document:

#### Content Structure:

When saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections:

```markdown
## [Project Type] Specific Requirements

### Project-Type Overview

[Project type summary based on conversation]

### Technical Architecture Considerations

[Technical architecture requirements based on conversation]

[Dynamic sections based on CSV and conversation]

### Implementation Considerations

[Implementation specific requirements based on conversation]
```

### 6. Step Completion

**Save Content:**
Append the content to the document using the structure from step 5 now.

**Confirmation:**
"Content saved to document.

I've documented the {project_type}-specific requirements for {{project_name}} based on our conversation and best practices for this type of product.

- If you want to **modify or add details**, just tell me what you'd like to change
- If you're satisfied, **press Enter in the promptbox to go to the next step**"

## SUCCESS METRICS:

✅ Project-type configuration used effectively from workflow context
✅ All key questions from CSV explored with user input
✅ Required sections generated per CSV configuration
✅ Skip sections properly avoided to save time
✅ Technical requirements connected to product value
✅ Content properly appended to document when user confirms

## FAILURE MODES:

❌ Not using project-type configuration from workflow context
❌ Missing key questions from CSV in discovery process
❌ Not generating required sections per CSV configuration
❌ Documenting sections that should be skipped per CSV
❌ Creating generic content without project-type specificity
❌ Appending content without user confirmation

## PROJECT-TYPE EXAMPLES:

**For api_backend:**

- Focus on endpoints, authentication, data schemas, rate limiting
- Skip visual design and user journey sections
- Generate API specification documentation

**For mobile_app:**

- Focus on platform requirements, device permissions, offline mode
- Skip API endpoint documentation unless needed
- Generate mobile-specific technical requirements

**For saas_b2b:**

- Focus on multi-tenancy, permissions, integrations
- Skip mobile-first considerations unless relevant
- Generate enterprise-specific requirements
