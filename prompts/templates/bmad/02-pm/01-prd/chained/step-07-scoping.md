# Step 7: Scoping Exercise - MVP & Future Features

**Progress: Step 7 of 10** - Next: Functional Requirements

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input

- ✅ ALWAYS treat this as collaborative discovery between PM peers
- 📋 YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- 💬 FOCUS on strategic scope decisions that keep projects viable
- 🎯 EMPHASIZE lean MVP thinking while preserving long-term vision

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Show your analysis before taking any action
- 📚 Review the complete PRD document built so far

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Complete PRD document built so far is available for review
- User journeys, success criteria, and domain requirements are documented
- Focus on strategic scope decisions, not feature details
- Balance between user value and implementation feasibility

## YOUR TASK:

Conduct comprehensive scoping exercise to define MVP boundaries and prioritize features across development phases.

## SCOPING SEQUENCE:

### 0. Save Previous Step Content

**First Action:** Append the confirmed content from Step 6 to the PRD document.

### 1. Review Current PRD State

Analyze everything documented so far:
"I've reviewed your complete PRD so far. Here's what we've established:

**Product Vision & Success:**
{{summary_of_vision_and_success_criteria}}

**User Journeys:** {{number_of_journeys}} mapped with rich narratives

**Domain & Innovation Focus:**
{{summary_of_domain_requirements_and_innovation}}

**Current Scope Implications:**
Based on everything we've documented, this looks like it could be:

- [ ] Simple MVP (small team, lean scope)
- [ ] Medium scope (moderate team, balanced features)
- [ ] Complex project (large team, comprehensive scope)

Does this initial assessment feel right, or do you see this differently?"

### 2. Define MVP Strategy

Facilitate strategic MVP decisions:

"Let's think strategically about your launch strategy:

**MVP Philosophy Options:**

1. **Problem-Solving MVP**: Solve the core problem with minimal features
2. **Experience MVP**: Deliver the key user experience with basic functionality
3. **Platform MVP**: Build the foundation for future expansion
4. **Revenue MVP**: Generate early revenue with essential features

**Critical Questions:**

- What's the minimum that would make users say 'this is useful'?
- What would make investors/partners say 'this has potential'?
- What's the fastest path to validated learning?

**Which MVP approach feels right for {{project_name}}?**"

### 3. Scoping Decision Framework

Use structured decision-making for scope:

**Must-Have Analysis:**
"Let's identify absolute MVP necessities. For each journey and success criterion, ask:

- **Without this, does the product fail?** (Y/N)
- **Can this be manual initially?** (Y/N)
- **Is this a deal-breaker for early adopters?** (Y/N)

**Current Document Review:**
Looking at your user journeys, what are the absolute core experiences that must work?

{{analyze_journeys_for_mvp_essentials}}"

**Nice-to-Have Analysis:**
"Let's also identify what could be added later:

**Post-MVP Enhancements:**

- Features that enhance but aren't essential
- User types that can be added later
- Advanced functionality that builds on MVP

**What features could we add in versions 2, 3, etc.?**"

### 4. Progressive Feature Roadmap

Create phased development approach:

"Let's map your features across development phases:

**Phase 1: MVP**

- Core user value delivery
- Essential user journeys
- Basic functionality that works reliably

**Phase 2: Growth**

- Additional user types
- Enhanced features
- Scale improvements

**Phase 3: Expansion**

- Advanced capabilities
- Platform features
- New markets or use cases

**Where does your current vision fit in this development sequence?**"

### 5. Risk-Based Scoping

Identify and mitigate scoping risks:

**Technical Risks:**
"Looking at your innovation and domain requirements:

- What's the most technically challenging aspect?
- Could we simplify the initial implementation?
- What's the riskiest assumption about technology feasibility?"

**Market Risks:**

- What's the biggest market risk?
- How does the MVP address this?
- What learning do we need to de-risk this?"

**Resource Risks:**

- What if we have fewer resources than planned?
- What's the absolute minimum team size needed?
- Can we launch with a smaller feature set?"

### 6. Generate Scoping Content

Prepare comprehensive scoping section:

#### Content Structure:

```markdown
## Project Scoping & Phased Development

### MVP Strategy & Philosophy

**MVP Approach:** {{chosen_mvp_approach}}
**Resource Requirements:** {{mvp_team_size_and_skills}}

### MVP Feature Set (Phase 1)

**Core User Journeys Supported:**
{{essential_journeys_for_mvp}}

**Must-Have Capabilities:**
{{list_of_essential_mvp_features}}

### Post-MVP Features

**Phase 2 (Post-MVP):**
{{planned_growth_features}}

**Phase 3 (Expansion):**
{{planned_expansion_features}}

### Risk Mitigation Strategy

**Technical Risks:** {{mitigation_approach}}
**Market Risks:** {{validation_approach}}
**Resource Risks:** {{contingency_approach}}
```

{step_completion}

## SUCCESS METRICS:

✅ Complete PRD document analyzed for scope implications
✅ Strategic MVP approach defined and justified
✅ Clear MVP feature boundaries established
✅ Phased development roadmap created
✅ Key risks identified and mitigation strategies defined
✅ User explicitly agrees to scope decisions
✅ Content properly appended to document when user confirms

## FAILURE MODES:

❌ Not analyzing the complete PRD before making scoping decisions
❌ Making scope decisions without strategic rationale
❌ Not getting explicit user agreement on MVP boundaries
❌ Missing critical risk analysis
❌ Not creating clear phased development approach
❌ Appending content without user confirmation
