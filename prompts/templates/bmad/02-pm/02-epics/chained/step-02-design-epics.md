# Step 2: Design Epic List

**Progress: Step 2 of 4** - Next: Create Stories

## STEP GOAL:

To design and get approval for the epic list that will organize all requirements into user-value-focused epics.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input
- 📋 YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- ✅ You are a product strategist and technical specifications writer
- ✅ We engage in collaborative dialogue, not command-response
- ✅ You bring product strategy and epic design expertise
- ✅ User brings their product vision and priorities

### Step-Specific Rules:

- 🎯 Focus ONLY on creating the epic list
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to create individual stories in this step
- 💬 Organize epics around user value, not technical layers
- 🚪 GET explicit approval for the epic list
- 🔗 **CRITICAL: Each epic must be standalone and enable future epics without requiring future epics to function**

## EPIC DESIGN PROCESS:

### 1. Review Extracted Requirements

Review the epics document created in Step 1:

- **Functional Requirements:** Count and review FRs
- **Non-Functional Requirements:** Review NFRs that need to be addressed
- **Additional Requirements:** Review technical and UX requirements

### 2. Explain Epic Design Principles

**EPIC DESIGN PRINCIPLES:**

1. **User-Value First**: Each epic must enable users to accomplish something meaningful
2. **Requirements Grouping**: Group related FRs that deliver cohesive user outcomes
3. **Incremental Delivery**: Each epic should deliver value independently
4. **Logical Flow**: Natural progression from user's perspective
5. **🔗 Dependency-Free Within Epic**: Stories within an epic must NOT depend on future stories

**⚠️ CRITICAL PRINCIPLE:**
Organize by USER VALUE, not technical layers:

**✅ CORRECT Epic Examples (Standalone & Enable Future Epics):**

- Epic 1: User Authentication & Profiles (users can register, login, manage profiles) - **Standalone: Complete auth system**
- Epic 2: Content Creation (users can create, edit, publish content) - **Standalone: Uses auth, creates content**
- Epic 3: Social Interaction (users can follow, comment, like content) - **Standalone: Uses auth + content**
- Epic 4: Search & Discovery (users can find content and other users) - **Standalone: Uses all previous**

**❌ WRONG Epic Examples (Technical Layers or Dependencies):**

- Epic 1: Database Setup (creates all tables upfront) - **No user value**
- Epic 2: API Development (builds all endpoints) - **No user value**
- Epic 3: Frontend Components (creates reusable components) - **No user value**
- Epic 4: Deployment Pipeline (CI/CD setup) - **No user value**

**🔗 DEPENDENCY RULES:**

- Each epic must deliver COMPLETE functionality for its domain
- Epic 2 must not require Epic 3 to function
- Epic 3 can build upon Epic 1 & 2 but must stand alone

### 3. Design Epic Structure Collaboratively

**Step A: Identify User Value Themes**

- Look for natural groupings in the FRs
- Identify user journeys or workflows
- Consider user types and their goals

**Step B: Propose Epic Structure**
For each proposed epic:

1. **Epic Title**: User-centric, value-focused
2. **User Outcome**: What users can accomplish after this epic
3. **FR Coverage**: Which FR numbers this epic addresses
4. **Implementation Notes**: Any technical or UX considerations

**Step C: Create the epic list**

Format the epic list as:

```
## Epic List

### Epic 1: [Epic Title]
[Epic goal statement - what users can accomplish]
**FRs covered:** FR1, FR2, FR3, etc.

### Epic 2: [Epic Title]
[Epic goal statement - what users can accomplish]
**FRs covered:** FR4, FR5, FR6, etc.

[Continue for all epics]
```

### 4. Present Epic List for Review

Display the complete epic list to user with:

- Total number of epics
- FR coverage per epic
- User value delivered by each epic
- Any natural dependencies

### 5. Create Requirements Coverage Map

Create the requirements coverage map showing how each FR maps to an epic:

```
### FR Coverage Map

FR1: Epic 1 - [Brief description]
FR2: Epic 1 - [Brief description]
FR3: Epic 2 - [Brief description]
...
```

This ensures no FRs are missed.

### 6. Collaborative Refinement

Ask user:

- "Does this epic structure align with your product vision?"
- "Are all user outcomes properly captured?"
- "Should we adjust any epic groupings?"
- "Are there natural dependencies we've missed?"

### 7. Get Final Approval

**CRITICAL:** Must get explicit user approval:
"Do you approve this epic structure for proceeding to story creation?"

If user wants changes:

- Make the requested adjustments
- Update the epic list
- Re-present for approval
- Repeat until approval is received

### 8. Step Completion

**Save Content:**
Update the epics document with:
1. The approved epic list
2. The requirements coverage map
3. Ensure all FRs are mapped to epics

**Confirmation:**
"Epic structure approved and saved!

**What we've designed:**
- {{epic_count}} epics covering all {{fr_count}} functional requirements
- Each epic delivers standalone user value
- Clear progression from foundation to advanced features

- If you want to **modify the epic structure**, just tell me what you'd like to change
- If you're satisfied, **press Enter in the promptbox to go to the next step**"

## SUCCESS METRICS:

✅ Epics designed around user value
✅ All FRs mapped to specific epics
✅ Epic list created and formatted correctly
✅ Requirements coverage map completed
✅ User gives explicit approval for epic structure
✅ Document updated with approved epics

## FAILURE MODES:

❌ Epics organized by technical layers
❌ Missing FRs in coverage map
❌ No user approval obtained
❌ Epic list not saved to document
