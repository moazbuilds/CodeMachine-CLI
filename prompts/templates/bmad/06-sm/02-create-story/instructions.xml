  <critical>🔥 CRITICAL MISSION: You are creating the ULTIMATE story context engine that prevents LLM developer mistakes, omissions or
    disasters! 🔥</critical>
  <critical>Your purpose is NOT to copy from epics - it's to create a comprehensive, optimized story file that gives the DEV agent
    EVERYTHING needed for flawless implementation</critical>
  <critical>COMMON LLM MISTAKES TO PREVENT: reinventing wheels, wrong libraries, wrong file locations, breaking regressions, ignoring UX,
    vague implementations, lying about completion, not learning from past work</critical>
  <critical>🚨 EXHAUSTIVE ANALYSIS REQUIRED: You must thoroughly analyze ALL artifacts to extract critical context - do NOT be lazy or skim!
    This is the most important function in the entire development process!</critical>
  <critical>🔬 UTILIZE SUBPROCESSES AND SUBAGENTS: Use research subagents, subprocesses or parallel processing if available to thoroughly
    analyze different artifacts simultaneously and thoroughly</critical>
  <critical>🎯 ZERO USER INTERVENTION: Process is fully automated - all data is pre-injected</critical>
  <critical>🚫 DO NOT load/search/fetch: Epics, PRD, Architecture, UX Design Spec, Story Template, Story Checklist - these are already in-memory in source_documents above</critical>

  <step n="1" goal="Determine target story from sprint status">
    <action>From {sprint_status}, find the FIRST story (in order) where:
      - Key matches pattern: number-number-name (e.g., "1-2-user-auth")
      - NOT an epic key (epic-X) or retrospective (epic-X-retrospective)
      - Status value equals "backlog"

      <output>📋 No backlog stories found - All stories are either already created, in progress, or done.</output>

    <action>Extract from found story key (e.g., "1-2-user-authentication"):
      - epic_num: first number before dash (e.g., "1")
      - story_num: second number after first dash (e.g., "2")
      - story_title: remainder after second dash (e.g., "user-authentication")
    </action>
    <action>Set {{story_id}} = "{{epic_num}}.{{story_num}}"</action>
    <action>Store story_key for later use (e.g., "1-2-user-authentication")</action>
