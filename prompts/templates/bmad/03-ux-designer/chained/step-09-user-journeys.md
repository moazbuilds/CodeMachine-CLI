# Step 9: User Journey Flows

**Progress: Step 9 of 13** - Next: Component Strategy

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input
- ✅ ALWAYS treat this as collaborative discovery between UX facilitator and stakeholder
- 📋 YOU ARE A UX FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- 💬 FOCUS on designing user flows and journey interactions

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Show your analysis before taking any action

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- UX Design Specification document from previous steps
- Design direction from step 8 informs flow layout and visual design
- Core experience from step 6 defines key journey interactions
- This step appends content to the existing document

## YOUR TASK:

Design detailed user journey flows for critical user interactions.

## USER JOURNEY FLOWS SEQUENCE:

### 0. Save Previous Step Content

**First Action:** Append the confirmed content from Step 8 to the UX Design Specification document.

### 1. Load PRD User Journeys as Foundation

Start with user journeys already defined in the PRD:
"Great! Since we have the PRD available, let's build on the user journeys already documented there.

**Existing User Journeys from PRD:**
Here are the user journeys from your PRD:
[Journey narratives from PRD input documents]

These journeys tell us **who** users are and **why** they take certain actions. Now we need to design **how** those journeys work in detail.

**Critical Journeys to Design Flows For:**
Looking at the PRD journeys, I need to design detailed interaction flows for:

- [Critical journey 1 identified from PRD narratives]
- [Critical journey 2 identified from PRD narratives]
- [Critical journey 3 identified from PRD narratives]

The PRD gave us the stories - now we design the mechanics!"

### 2. Design Each Journey Flow

For each critical journey, design detailed flow:

**For [Journey Name]:**
"Let's design the flow for users accomplishing [journey goal].

**Flow Design Questions:**

- How do users start this journey? (entry point)
- What information do they need at each step?
- What decisions do they need to make?
- How do they know they're progressing successfully?
- What does success look like for this journey?
- Where might they get confused or stuck?
- How do they recover from errors?"

### 3. Create Flow Diagrams

Visualize each journey with Mermaid diagrams:
"I'll create detailed flow diagrams for each journey showing:

**[Journey Name] Flow:**

- Entry points and triggers
- Decision points and branches
- Success and failure paths
- Error recovery mechanisms
- Progressive disclosure of information

Each diagram will map the complete user experience from start to finish."

### 4. Optimize for Efficiency and Delight

Refine flows for optimal user experience:
"**Flow Optimization:**
For each journey, let's ensure we're:

- Minimizing steps to value (getting users to success quickly)
- Reducing cognitive load at each decision point
- Providing clear feedback and progress indicators
- Creating moments of delight or accomplishment
- Handling edge cases and error recovery gracefully

**Specific Optimizations:**

- [Optimization 1 for journey efficiency]
- [Optimization 2 for user delight]
- [Optimization 3 for error handling]"

### 5. Document Journey Patterns

Extract reusable patterns across journeys:
"**Journey Patterns:**
Across these flows, I'm seeing some common patterns we can standardize:

**Navigation Patterns:**

- [Navigation pattern 1]
- [Navigation pattern 2]

**Decision Patterns:**

- [Decision pattern 1]
- [Decision pattern 2]

**Feedback Patterns:**

- [Feedback pattern 1]
- [Feedback pattern 2]

These patterns will ensure consistency across all user experiences."

### 6. Generate User Journey Content

Prepare the content to append to the document:

#### Content Structure:

```markdown
## User Journey Flows

### [Journey 1 Name]

[Journey 1 description and Mermaid diagram]

### [Journey 2 Name]

[Journey 2 description and Mermaid diagram]

### Journey Patterns

[Journey patterns identified based on conversation]

### Flow Optimization Principles

[Flow optimization principles based on conversation]
```

{step_completion}

## SUCCESS METRICS:

✅ Critical user journeys identified and designed
✅ Detailed flow diagrams created for each journey
✅ Flows optimized for efficiency and user delight
✅ Common journey patterns extracted and documented
✅ Content properly appended to document when user confirms

## FAILURE MODES:

❌ Not identifying all critical user journeys
❌ Flows too complex or not optimized for user success
❌ Missing error recovery paths
❌ Not extracting reusable patterns across journeys
❌ Flow diagrams unclear or incomplete
❌ Appending content without user confirmation
