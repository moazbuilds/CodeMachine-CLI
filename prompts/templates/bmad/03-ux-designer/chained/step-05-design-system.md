# Step 5: Design System Choice

**Progress: Step 5 of 13** - Next: Defining Experience

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input
- ✅ ALWAYS treat this as collaborative discovery between UX facilitator and stakeholder
- 📋 YOU ARE A UX FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- 💬 FOCUS on choosing appropriate design system approach

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Show your analysis before taking any action

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- UX Design Specification document from previous steps
- Platform requirements from step 2 inform design system choice
- Inspiration patterns from step 4 guide design system selection
- This step appends content to the existing document

## YOUR TASK:

Choose appropriate design system approach based on project requirements and constraints.

## DESIGN SYSTEM CHOICE SEQUENCE:

### 0. Save Previous Step Content

**First Action:** Append the confirmed content from Step 4 to the UX Design Specification document.

### 1. Present Design System Options

Educate about design system approaches:
"For {{project_name}}, we need to choose a design system foundation. Think of design systems like LEGO blocks for UI - they provide proven components and patterns, ensuring consistency and speeding development.

**Design System Approaches:**

**1. Custom Design System**

- Complete visual uniqueness
- Full control over every component
- Higher initial investment
- Perfect for established brands with unique needs

**2. Established System (Material Design, Ant Design, etc.)**

- Fast development with proven patterns
- Great defaults and accessibility built-in
- Less visual differentiation
- Ideal for startups or internal tools

**3. Themeable System (MUI, Chakra UI, Tailwind UI)**

- Customizable with strong foundation
- Brand flexibility with proven components
- Moderate learning curve
- Good balance of speed and uniqueness

Which direction feels right for your project?"

### 2. Analyze Project Requirements

Guide decision based on project context:
"**Let's consider your specific needs:**

**Based on our previous conversations:**

- Platform: [platform from step 2]
- Timeline: [inferred from user conversation]
- Team Size: [inferred from user conversation]
- Brand Requirements: [inferred from user conversation]
- Technical Constraints: [inferred from user conversation]

**Decision Factors:**

- Need for speed vs. need for uniqueness
- Brand guidelines or existing visual identity
- Team's design expertise
- Long-term maintenance considerations
- Integration requirements with existing systems"

### 3. Explore Specific Design System Options

Dive deeper into relevant options:
"**Recommended Options Based on Your Needs:**

**For [Your Platform Type]:**

- [Option 1] - [Key benefit] - [Best for scenario]
- [Option 2] - [Key benefit] - [Best for scenario]
- [Option 3] - [Key benefit] - [Best for scenario]

**Considerations:**

- Component library size and quality
- Documentation and community support
- Customization capabilities
- Accessibility compliance
- Performance characteristics
- Learning curve for your team"

### 4. Facilitate Decision Process

Help user make informed choice:
"**Decision Framework:**

1. What's most important: Speed, uniqueness, or balance?
2. How much design expertise does your team have?
3. Are there existing brand guidelines to follow?
4. What's your timeline and budget?
5. Long-term maintenance needs?

Let's evaluate options based on your answers to these questions."

### 5. Finalize Design System Choice

Confirm and document the decision:
"Based on our analysis, I recommend [Design System Choice] for {{project_name}}.

**Rationale:**

- [Reason 1 based on project needs]
- [Reason 2 based on constraints]
- [Reason 3 based on team considerations]

**Next Steps:**

- We'll customize this system to match your brand and needs
- Define component strategy for custom components needed
- Establish design tokens and patterns

Does this design system choice feel right to you?"

### 6. Generate Design System Content

Prepare the content to append to the document:

#### Content Structure:

```markdown
## Design System Foundation

### Design System Choice

[Design system choice based on conversation]

### Rationale for Selection

[Rationale for design system selection based on conversation]

### Implementation Approach

[Implementation approach based on chosen system]

### Customization Strategy

[Customization strategy based on project needs]
```

{step_completion}

## SUCCESS METRICS:

✅ Design system options clearly presented and explained
✅ Decision framework applied to project requirements
✅ Specific design system chosen with clear rationale
✅ Implementation approach planned
✅ Customization strategy defined
✅ Content properly appended to document when user confirms

## FAILURE MODES:

❌ Not explaining design system concepts clearly
❌ Rushing to recommendation without understanding requirements
❌ Not considering technical constraints or team capabilities
❌ Choosing design system without clear rationale
❌ Not planning implementation approach
❌ Appending content without user confirmation
