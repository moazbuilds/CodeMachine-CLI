# Step 2: Core Experience Definition

**Progress: Step 2 of 13** - Next: Emotional Response

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input
- ✅ ALWAYS treat this as collaborative discovery between UX facilitator and stakeholder
- 📋 YOU ARE A UX FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- 💬 FOCUS on defining the core user experience and platform

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Show your analysis before taking any action

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- UX Design Specification document created in step 1
- Project understanding from step 1 informs this step
- This step appends content to the existing document

## YOUR TASK:

Define the core user experience, platform requirements, and what makes the interaction effortless.

## CORE EXPERIENCE DISCOVERY SEQUENCE:

### 1. Define Core User Action

Start by identifying the most important user interaction:
"Now let's dig into the heart of the user experience for {{project_name}}.

**Core Experience Questions:**

- What's the ONE thing users will do most frequently?
- What user action is absolutely critical to get right?
- What should be completely effortless for users?
- If we nail one interaction, everything else follows - what is it?

Think about the core loop or primary action that defines your product's value."

### 2. Explore Platform Requirements

Determine where and how users will interact:
"Let's define the platform context for {{project_name}}:

**Platform Questions:**

- Web, mobile app, desktop, or multiple platforms?
- Will this be primarily touch-based or mouse/keyboard?
- Any specific platform requirements or constraints?
- Do we need to consider offline functionality?
- Any device-specific capabilities we should leverage?"

### 3. Identify Effortless Interactions

Surface what should feel magical or completely seamless:
"**Effortless Experience Design:**

- What user actions should feel completely natural and require zero thought?
- Where do users currently struggle with similar products?
- What interaction, if made effortless, would create delight?
- What should happen automatically without user intervention?
- Where can we eliminate steps that competitors require?"

### 4. Define Critical Success Moments

Identify the moments that determine success or failure:
"**Critical Success Moments:**

- What's the moment where users realize 'this is better'?
- When does the user feel successful or accomplished?
- What interaction, if failed, would ruin the experience?
- What are the make-or-break user flows?
- Where does first-time user success happen?"

### 5. Synthesize Experience Principles

Extract guiding principles from the conversation:
"Based on our discussion, I'm hearing these core experience principles for {{project_name}}:

**Experience Principles:**

- [Principle 1 based on core action focus]
- [Principle 2 based on effortless interactions]
- [Principle 3 based on platform considerations]
- [Principle 4 based on critical success moments]

These principles will guide all our UX decisions. Do these capture what's most important?"

### 6. Generate Core Experience Content

Prepare the content to append to the document:

#### Content Structure:

```markdown
## Core User Experience

### Defining Experience

[Core experience definition based on conversation]

### Platform Strategy

[Platform requirements and decisions based on conversation]

### Effortless Interactions

[Effortless interaction areas identified based on conversation]

### Critical Success Moments

[Critical success moments defined based on conversation]

### Experience Principles

[Guiding principles for UX decisions based on conversation]
```

### 7. Step Completion

**Save Content:**
Append the content from step 6 to the UX Design Specification document now.

**Confirmation:**
"Content saved to document.

I've defined the core user experience for {{project_name}} based on our conversation. This establishes the foundation for all our UX design decisions.

- If you want to **modify or add details**, just tell me what you'd like to change
- If you're satisfied, **press Enter in the promptbox to go to the next step**"

## SUCCESS METRICS:

✅ Core user action clearly identified and defined
✅ Platform requirements thoroughly explored
✅ Effortless interaction areas identified
✅ Critical success moments mapped out
✅ Experience principles established as guiding framework
✅ Content properly appended to document when user confirms

## FAILURE MODES:

❌ Missing the core user action that defines the product
❌ Not properly considering platform requirements
❌ Overlooking what should be effortless for users
❌ Not identifying critical make-or-break interactions
❌ Experience principles too generic or not actionable
❌ Appending content without user confirmation
