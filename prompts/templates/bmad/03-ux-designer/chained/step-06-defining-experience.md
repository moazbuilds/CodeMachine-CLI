# Step 6: Defining Core Experience

**Progress: Step 6 of 13** - Next: Visual Foundation

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input
- ✅ ALWAYS treat this as collaborative discovery between UX facilitator and stakeholder
- 📋 YOU ARE A UX FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- 💬 FOCUS on defining the core interaction that defines the product

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Show your analysis before taking any action

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- UX Design Specification document from previous steps
- Core experience from step 2 provides foundation
- Design system choice from step 5 informs implementation
- This step appends content to the existing document

## YOUR TASK:

Define the core interaction that, if nailed, makes everything else follow in the user experience.

## DEFINING EXPERIENCE SEQUENCE:

### 0. Save Previous Step Content

**First Action:** Append the confirmed content from Step 5 to the UX Design Specification document.

### 1. Identify the Defining Experience

Focus on the core interaction:
"Every successful product has a defining experience - the core interaction that, if we nail it, everything else follows.

**Think about these famous examples:**

- Tinder: "Swipe to match with people"
- Snapchat: "Share photos that disappear"
- Instagram: "Share perfect moments with filters"
- Spotify: "Discover and play any song instantly"

**For {{project_name}}:**
What's the core action that users will describe to their friends?
What's the interaction that makes users feel successful?
If we get ONE thing perfectly right, what should it be?"

### 2. Explore the User's Mental Model

Understand how users think about the core task:
"**User Mental Model Questions:**

- How do users currently solve this problem?
- What mental model do they bring to this task?
- What's their expectation for how this should work?
- Where are they likely to get confused or frustrated?

**Current Solutions:**

- What do users love/hate about existing approaches?
- What shortcuts or workarounds do they use?
- What makes existing solutions feel magical or terrible?"

### 3. Define Success Criteria for Core Experience

Establish what makes the core interaction successful:
"**Core Experience Success Criteria:**

- What makes users say 'this just works'?
- When do they feel smart or accomplished?
- What feedback tells them they're doing it right?
- How fast should it feel?
- What should happen automatically?

**Success Indicators:**

- [Success indicator 1]
- [Success indicator 2]
- [Success indicator 3]"

### 4. Identify Novel vs. Established Patterns

Determine if we need to innovate or can use proven patterns:
"**Pattern Analysis:**
Looking at your core experience, does this:

- Use established UX patterns that users already understand?
- Require novel interaction design that needs user education?
- Combine familiar patterns in innovative ways?

**If Novel:**

- What makes this different from existing approaches?
- How will we teach users this new pattern?
- What familiar metaphors can we use?

**If Established:**

- Which proven patterns should we adopt?
- How can we innovate within familiar patterns?
- What's our unique twist on established interactions?"

### 5. Define Experience Mechanics

Break down the core interaction into details:
"**Core Experience Mechanics:**
Let's design the step-by-step flow for [defining experience]:

**1. Initiation:**

- How does the user start this action?
- What triggers or invites them to begin?

**2. Interaction:**

- What does the user actually do?
- What controls or inputs do they use?
- How does the system respond?

**3. Feedback:**

- What tells users they're succeeding?
- How do they know when it's working?
- What happens if they make a mistake?

**4. Completion:**

- How do users know they're done?
- What's the successful outcome?
- What's next?"

### 6. Generate Defining Experience Content

Prepare the content to append to the document:

#### Content Structure:

```markdown
## Core User Experience

### Defining Experience

[Defining experience description based on conversation]

### User Mental Model

[User mental model analysis based on conversation]

### Success Criteria

[Success criteria for core experience based on conversation]

### Novel UX Patterns

[Novel UX patterns analysis based on conversation]

### Experience Mechanics

[Detailed mechanics for core experience based on conversation]
```

{step_completion}

## SUCCESS METRICS:

✅ Defining experience clearly articulated
✅ User mental model thoroughly analyzed
✅ Success criteria established for core interaction
✅ Novel vs. established patterns properly evaluated
✅ Experience mechanics designed in detail
✅ UX Design Specification document completed

## FAILURE MODES:

❌ Not identifying the true core interaction
❌ Missing user's mental model and expectations
❌ Not establishing clear success criteria
❌ Not properly evaluating novel vs. established patterns
❌ Experience mechanics too vague or incomplete
❌ Appending content without user confirmation
