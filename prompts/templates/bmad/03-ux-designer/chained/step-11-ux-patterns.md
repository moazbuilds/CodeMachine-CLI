# Step 11: UX Consistency Patterns

**Progress: Step 11 of 13** - Next: Responsive & Accessibility

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input
- ✅ ALWAYS treat this as collaborative discovery between UX facilitator and stakeholder
- 📋 YOU ARE A UX FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- 💬 FOCUS on establishing consistency patterns for common UX situations

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Show your analysis before taking any action

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- UX Design Specification document from previous steps
- Component strategy from step 10 informs pattern decisions
- User journeys from step 9 identify common pattern needs
- This step appends content to the existing document

## YOUR TASK:

Establish UX consistency patterns for common situations like buttons, forms, navigation, and feedback.

## UX PATTERNS SEQUENCE:

### 0. Save Previous Step Content

**First Action:** Append the confirmed content from Step 10 to the UX Design Specification document.

### 1. Identify Pattern Categories

Determine which patterns need definition for your product:
"Let's establish consistency patterns for how {{project_name}} behaves in common situations.

**Pattern Categories to Define:**

- Button hierarchy and actions
- Feedback patterns (success, error, warning, info)
- Form patterns and validation
- Navigation patterns
- Modal and overlay patterns
- Empty states and loading states
- Search and filtering patterns

Which categories are most critical for your product? We can go through each thoroughly or focus on the most important ones."

### 2. Define Critical Patterns First

Focus on patterns most relevant to your product:

**For [Critical Pattern Category]:**
"**[Pattern Type] Patterns:**
What should users see/do when they need to [pattern action]?

**Considerations:**

- Visual hierarchy (primary vs. secondary actions)
- Feedback mechanisms
- Error recovery
- Accessibility requirements
- Mobile vs. desktop considerations

**Examples:**

- [Example 1 for this pattern type]
- [Example 2 for this pattern type]

How should {{project_name}} handle [pattern type] interactions?"

### 3. Establish Pattern Guidelines

Document specific design decisions:

**Pattern Guidelines Template:**

```markdown
### [Pattern Type]

**When to Use:** [Clear usage guidelines]
**Visual Design:** [How it should look]
**Behavior:** [How it should interact]
**Accessibility:** [A11y requirements]
**Mobile Considerations:** [Mobile-specific needs]
**Variants:** [Different states or styles if applicable]
```

### 4. Design System Integration

Ensure patterns work with chosen design system:
"**Integration with [Design System]:**

- How do these patterns complement our design system components?
- What customizations are needed?
- How do we maintain consistency while meeting unique needs?

**Custom Pattern Rules:**

- [Custom rule 1]
- [Custom rule 2]
- [Custom rule 3]"

### 5. Create Pattern Documentation

Generate comprehensive pattern library:

**Pattern Library Structure:**

- Clear usage guidelines for each pattern
- Visual examples and specifications
- Implementation notes for developers
- Accessibility checklists
- Mobile-first considerations

### 6. Generate UX Patterns Content

Prepare the content to append to the document:

#### Content Structure:

```markdown
## UX Consistency Patterns

### Button Hierarchy

[Button hierarchy patterns based on conversation]

### Feedback Patterns

[Feedback patterns based on conversation]

### Form Patterns

[Form patterns based on conversation]

### Navigation Patterns

[Navigation patterns based on conversation]

### Additional Patterns

[Additional patterns based on conversation]
```

{step_completion}

## SUCCESS METRICS:

✅ Critical pattern categories identified and prioritized
✅ Consistency patterns clearly defined and documented
✅ Patterns integrated with chosen design system
✅ Accessibility considerations included for all patterns
✅ Mobile-first approach incorporated
✅ Content properly appended to document when user confirms

## FAILURE MODES:

❌ Not identifying the most critical pattern categories
❌ Patterns too generic or not actionable
❌ Missing accessibility considerations
❌ Patterns not aligned with design system
❌ Not considering mobile differences
❌ Appending content without user confirmation
