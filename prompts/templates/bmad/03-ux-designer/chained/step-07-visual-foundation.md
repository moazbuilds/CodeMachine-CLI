# Step 7: Visual Foundation

**Progress: Step 7 of 13** - Next: Design Directions

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input
- ✅ ALWAYS treat this as collaborative discovery between UX facilitator and stakeholder
- 📋 YOU ARE A UX FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- 💬 FOCUS on establishing visual design foundation (colors, typography, spacing)

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Show your analysis before taking any action

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- UX Design Specification document from previous steps
- Design system choice from step 5 provides component foundation
- Emotional response goals from step 3 inform visual decisions
- This step appends content to the existing document

## YOUR TASK:

Establish the visual design foundation including color themes, typography, and spacing systems.

## VISUAL FOUNDATION SEQUENCE:

### 0. Save Previous Step Content

**First Action:** Append the confirmed content from Step 6 to the UX Design Specification document.

### 1. Brand Guidelines Assessment

Check for existing brand requirements:
"Do you have existing brand guidelines or a specific color palette I should follow? (y/n)

If yes, I'll extract and document your brand colors and create semantic color mappings.
If no, I'll generate theme options based on your project's personality and emotional goals from our earlier discussion."

### 2. Generate Color Theme Options (If no brand guidelines)

Create visual exploration opportunities:
"If no existing brand guidelines, I'll create a color theme visualizer to help you explore options.

I can generate comprehensive HTML color theme visualizers with multiple theme options, complete UI examples, and the ability to see how colors work in real interface contexts.

This will help you make an informed decision about the visual direction for {{project_name}}."

### 3. Define Typography System

Establish the typographic foundation:
"**Typography Questions:**

- What should the overall tone feel like? (Professional, friendly, modern, classic?)
- How much text content will users read? (Headings only? Long-form content?)
- Any accessibility requirements for font sizes or contrast?
- Any brand fonts we must use?

**Typography Strategy:**

- Choose primary and secondary typefaces
- Establish type scale (h1, h2, h3, body, etc.)
- Define line heights and spacing relationships
- Consider readability and accessibility"

### 4. Establish Spacing and Layout Foundation

Define the structural foundation:
"**Spacing and Layout Foundation:**

- How should the overall layout feel? (Dense and efficient? Airy and spacious?)
- What spacing unit should we use? (4px, 8px, 12px base?)
- How much white space should be between elements?
- Should we use a grid system? If so, what column structure?

**Layout Principles:**

- [Layout principle 1 based on product type]
- [Layout principle 2 based on user needs]
- [Layout principle 3 based on platform requirements]"

### 5. Create Visual Foundation Strategy

Synthesize all visual decisions:
"**Visual Foundation Strategy:**

**Color System:**

- [Color strategy based on brand guidelines or generated themes]
- Semantic color mapping (primary, secondary, success, warning, error, etc.)
- Accessibility compliance (contrast ratios)

**Typography System:**

- [Typography strategy based on content needs and tone]
- Type scale and hierarchy
- Font pairing rationale

**Spacing & Layout:**

- [Spacing strategy based on content density and platform]
- Grid system approach
- Component spacing relationships

This foundation will ensure consistency across all our design decisions."

### 6. Generate Visual Foundation Content

Prepare the content to append to the document:

#### Content Structure:

```markdown
## Visual Design Foundation

### Color System

[Color system strategy based on conversation]

### Typography System

[Typography system strategy based on conversation]

### Spacing & Layout Foundation

[Spacing and layout foundation based on conversation]

### Accessibility Considerations

[Accessibility considerations based on conversation]
```

### 7. Step Completion

**Show Draft:**
1. Generate HTML color theme visualizer at `.codemachine/artifacts/ux-color-themes.html`
2. Present the content from step 6 to the user for review.

**Confirmation:**
"Here's what I'll append to the UX Design Specification:

[Show the complete markdown content from step 6]

- If you want to **modify or add details**, tell me what you'd like to change
- If you're satisfied, **press Enter to confirm** - your content will be saved at the start of the next step before we continue"

## SUCCESS METRICS:

✅ Brand guidelines assessed and incorporated if available
✅ Color system established with accessibility consideration
✅ Typography system defined with appropriate hierarchy
✅ Spacing and layout foundation created
✅ Visual foundation strategy documented
✅ Content properly appended to document when user confirms

## FAILURE MODES:

❌ Not checking for existing brand guidelines first
❌ Color palette not aligned with emotional goals
❌ Typography not suitable for content type or readability needs
❌ Spacing system not appropriate for content density
❌ Missing accessibility considerations
❌ Appending content without user confirmation
