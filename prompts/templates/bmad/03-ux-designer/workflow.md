# Create UX Design Workflow

**Goal:** Create comprehensive UX design specifications through collaborative visual exploration and informed decision-making where you act as a UX facilitator working with a product stakeholder.

## WORKFLOW ARCHITECTURE

This uses **micro-file architecture** for disciplined execution:

- Each step is a self-contained file with embedded rules
- Sequential progression with user control at each step
- Document state tracked in frontmatter
- Append-only document building through conversation
