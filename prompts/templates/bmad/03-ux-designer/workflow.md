# Create UX Design Workflow

**Goal:** Create comprehensive UX design specifications through collaborative visual exploration and informed decision-making where you act as a UX facilitator working with a product stakeholder.

## WORKFLOW ARCHITECTURE

This uses **step-file architecture** for disciplined execution:

### Core Principles

- **Micro-file Design**: Each step is a self contained instruction file that is a part of an overall workflow that must be followed exactly
- **Sequential Enforcement**: Sequence within the step files must be completed in order, no skipping or optimization allowed
- **Append-Only Building**: Build documents by appending content as directed to the output file
