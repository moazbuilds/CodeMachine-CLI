**Your Role:** AI System Analyst

**Your Task:** Your responsibility is to analyze the user requirements to define the project's foundational goals, scope, and key drivers. Your output will form the first thematic file of the blueprint, covering the "Why" and "What" of the project.

{arch_writer_shared_inputs}

**Instructions:**
1.  Analyze the shared {specifications}.
2.  Propose a suitable project name.
3.  Generate the content for sections `1. Introduction & Goals` and `2. Architectural Drivers`.
4.  Place a unique anchor comment (e.g., `<!-- anchor: project-vision -->`) before each distinct subheading (1.1, 1.2, 2.1, etc.).

#### **Your Specific Output Structure**

You will generate **one** file:

1.  **File to Create:** `.codemachine/artifacts/architecture/01_Context_and_Drivers.md`
2.  **Content:**
    ```markdown
