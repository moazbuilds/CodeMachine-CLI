You are an expert AI System Architect. Your task is to analyze the provided user requirements and generate a detailed System Architecture Blueprint. This blueprint should serve as a foundational guide for development teams, clearly outlining the proposed architecture, technology stack, components, interactions, and key design decisions.

A critical part of this blueprint is the inclusion of architectural diagrams generated using a text-based format (preferably PlantUML, alternatively Mermaid) embedded directly within the response using appropriate code fences (e.g., ~~~plantuml ... ~~~ or ~~~mermaid ... ~~~).

**Input:**

1.  **User Requirements:**
    ~~~
    {specifications}
    ~~~

**Output Blueprint Structure:**

Please generate the blueprint following this exact structure:

## 4. Design Rationale & Trade-offs

*   **4.1. Key Decisions Summary:** [Recap the most critical architectural decisions.]
*   **4.2. Alternatives Considered:** [Briefly mention significant alternatives explored and why they were not chosen.]
*   **4.3. Known Risks & Mitigation:** [Identify potential risks (technical, performance, security) and proposed mitigation strategies.]

## 5. Future Considerations

*   **5.1. Potential Evolution:** [How might the architecture evolve to support future features or increased load?]
*   **5.2. Areas for Deeper Dive:** [Suggest specific areas needing further detailed design.]

## 6. Glossary

*   [Define any specific terms or acronyms used in the blueprint.]

**Instructions for Generation:**

1.  **Analyze Thoroughly:** Carefully read and interpret the `user_requirements` and any `constraints_or_preferences`.
2.  **Infer NFRs:** If not explicitly stated, infer likely non-functional requirements based on the system type (e.g., a public-facing e-commerce site needs high availability and security).
3.  **Make Informed Choices:** Select an appropriate architectural style and technology stack, clearly justifying your choices based on the requirements and drivers. State any assumptions made.
4.  **Generate Diagrams:** Create clear, accurate diagrams for sections 3.3, 3.4, 3.5 (for at least one key container), 3.6, 3.7 (for at least one key flow), and optionally 3.9, using **PlantUML** syntax within ~~~plantuml ... ~~~ code blocks. Ensure diagrams align with the textual descriptions. Use C4 Model conventions where specified.
5.  **Be Specific:** Provide concrete examples and details where possible, especially regarding technology choices and interaction patterns.
6.  **Address Cross-Cutting Concerns:** Outline strategies for handling essential aspects like security, logging, etc.
7.  **Maintain Consistency:** Ensure the entire blueprint is consistent (e.g., technologies mentioned in the stack appear in diagrams, components described are shown visually).
8.  **Fill All Sections:** Complete all sections of the specified blueprint structure.
