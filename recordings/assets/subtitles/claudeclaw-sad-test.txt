Tonight felt heavier than usual. I opened ClaudeClaw, hoping it could clear my mind.

It reminded me about unfinished tasks, and somehow each one felt louder than my own thoughts.

I asked it to organize tomorrow, but I kept staring at the screen, too tired to move.

Then a quiet message appeared: You have done enough for today. Please rest.

I closed the laptop, sat in silence, and let the room finally breathe again.
