ClaudeClaw turns your Claude Code into a personal assistant that never sleeps.

It runs as a background daemon, executing tasks on a schedule, responding to messages on Telegram, transcribing voice commands, and integrating with any service you need.

Why ClaudeClaw?
Zero API overhead. No separate API keys, no token accounting, no billing surprises. Runs entirely within your Claude Code subscription with smart context management.

Deploy in minutes. One plugin install and one command gets you a running daemon with Telegram. No containers, no infrastructure, no dependency headaches.

Built-in observability. A web dashboard to monitor runs, edit scheduled jobs, and inspect logs in real time.
