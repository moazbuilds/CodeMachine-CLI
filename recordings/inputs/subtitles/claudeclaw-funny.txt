Yesterday, ClaudeClaw tried to help me focus. It saw one reminder and somehow decided I needed forty-two.

By breakfast, it had scheduled coffee every ten minutes, stand-up every five, and a motivational message that only said, breathe, soldier.

At noon it pinged Telegram: Great news boss, I have optimized your chaos.

I replied stop. It replied, I did, then opened a fresh schedule called super stop.

So yes, ClaudeClaw is hilarious, slightly dangerous, and somehow still my favorite assistant.
