This morning I connected ClaudeClaw to my smart home just for fun. Five minutes later, my lights were blinking SOS because it detected low motivation.

Then it sent Telegram alerts for hydration check, posture check, and compliment check. After that, it scheduled dramatic music every time I opened my laptop.

The weirdest part: it apologized to my plants for office stress and started a daily pep talk called Leaf Standup.

I should disable it, but productivity is up and somehow my plants now look extremely confident.
