**CodeMachine is an orchestration layer for AI coding engines.**

## How It Works

CodeMachine wraps AI coding CLIs using their official scripting and automation modes. It spawns engines via CLI, passes arguments, and coordinates workflows—nothing more.

<Note>
  CodeMachine does not modify, patch, or extend engine functionality. It calls engines exactly as documented in their official automation guides.
</Note>

## Your Responsibilities

When using CodeMachine with any engine, you are responsible for:

- **Compliance** — Following each engine's terms of service
- **Authentication** — Maintaining valid subscriptions or API access
- **Usage limits** — Respecting rate limits and usage policies
- **Content policies** — Adhering to each provider's acceptable use policies

<Warning>
  CodeMachine passes your requests to the engines you configure. Ensure your use complies with each engine's policies.
</Warning>
