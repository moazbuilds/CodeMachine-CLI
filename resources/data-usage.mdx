## Context Window Display

CodeMachine displays the context window size for each engine in the TUI, sourced from each engine's realtime session data. You can see:

- **Controller Agent Context Window** - The context usage for the controller agent
- **Step Agent Context Window** - The context usage for individual step agents

<Note>
The context window displayed does not equal your actual token spend. It represents the current context size being used by each agent during the session.
</Note>

## Token Spending

CodeMachine does not spend any extra tokens on its own. It acts purely as a wrapping layer for the underlying engine services.

## Costs and Calculations

All cost calculations and token accounting are handled directly by each engine service provider, not by CodeMachine. This means:

- Billing is determined by the engine you're using (e.g., Anthropic, OpenAI)
- Token counts and pricing follow each provider's standard rates
- CodeMachine passes through requests without adding overhead

For accurate cost tracking, refer to your engine provider's dashboard and billing documentation.
