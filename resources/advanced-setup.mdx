## System Requirements

### For Users (Binary Installation)

The CodeMachine binary bundles the Bun runtime, so no additional tooling is required.

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **OS** | Linux (x64, arm64), macOS (x64, arm64), Windows (x64) |
| **RAM** | 4GB minimum, 8GB+ recommended for parallel agents |
| **Disk** | 100MB for binary + space for logs |
| **AI Engine** | At least one supported engine installed (Claude Code, Codex, etc.) |

### For Developers (Building from Source)

| Requirement | Version |
|-------------|---------|
| **Bun** | >= 1.3.3 |
| **Node.js** | >= 20.10.0 (for tooling) |
| **Git** | Latest |

## Resource Scaling Guide

Running multiple parallel agents requires additional system resources. Use this table to plan your infrastructure:

| Workload | RAM | CPU | Notes |
|----------|-----|-----|-------|
| Single agent | 2 GB | 1 core | Light tasks |
| 5 parallel agents | 4 GB | 2 cores | Small workflows |
| 10-20 parallel agents | 8-16 GB | 4+ cores | Production workflows |
| 20+ parallel agents | 32 GB+ | 8+ cores | Heavy swarms |

<Note>
These requirements are for running multiple AI engine processes simultaneously, not for build tooling.
</Note>

## Building from Source

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the Repository">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/moazbuilds/CodeMachine-CLI.git
    cd CodeMachine-CLI
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install Dependencies">
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run in Development Mode">
    ```bash
    bun dev
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build for Production">
    ```bash
    bun run build
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Accordion title="Optional: Link bun globally" icon="link" defaultOpen={true}>
  To use `cm` as a global command while developing, link the package:

  ```bash
  bun link
  ```

  Now you can run `cm` from anywhere on your system. To unlink:

  ```bash
  bun unlink codemachine
  ```
</Accordion>

## Manual Installation

If you prefer not to use a package manager, you can download the binary directly from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/moazbuilds/CodeMachine-CLI/releases) page.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Linux/macOS">
    ```bash
    # Download the binary for your platform
    curl -fsSL https://github.com/moazbuilds/CodeMachine-CLI/releases/latest/download/codemachine-linux-x64 -o codemachine

    # Make it executable
    chmod +x codemachine

    # Move to your PATH
    sudo mv codemachine /usr/local/bin/

    # Create cm alias
    sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/codemachine /usr/local/bin/cm
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows">
    Download `codemachine-win-x64.exe` from the releases page and add it to your system PATH.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Manual Update

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="npm">
    ```bash
    npm i -g codemachine@latest
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="bun">
    ```bash
    bun add -g codemachine@latest
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Uninstallation

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="npm">
    ```bash
    npm uninstall -g codemachine
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="bun">
    ```bash
    bun remove -g codemachine
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Manual">
    ```bash
    sudo rm /usr/local/bin/codemachine /usr/local/bin/cm
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
Configuration files are stored in `~/.codemachine/`. Remove this directory to completely clean up. Also remove `./.codemachine` in your project to delete runtime data and reset CodeMachine.
