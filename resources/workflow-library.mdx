## Ali Workflow Builder

<Badge color="green">Built-in</Badge> <Badge color="blue">Stable</Badge>

Ali is the built-in workflow that helps you create your own CodeMachine workflows. It guides you through defining agents, prompts, tracks, conditions, and workflow configuration.

### When to Use

- Building a new workflow from scratch
- Modifying or updating an existing workflow
- Learning how CodeMachine workflows work
- Getting help with workflow development

### Modes

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Expert Mode">
    A guided 5-step process for complex or custom workflows:

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Brainstorming">
        Optional creative exploration and idea generation for your workflow concept.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Workflow Definition">
        Define workflow name, tracks, conditions, and autonomous mode.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Agents">
        Configure main agents, sub-agents, modules, and controller.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Prompts">
        Create and configure agent prompts and placeholders.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Workflow Generation">
        Generate final workflow files and validate configuration.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    You can also select specific phases to focus on instead of the full workflow.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Quick Mode">
    One-step build with all requirements gathered upfront. Best when you prioritize speed over customization.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Actions

Ali can help you with three main actions:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Create Workflow** | Build a new workflow from scratch |
| **Modify Workflow** | Edit or update an existing workflow |
| **Have Questions** | Ask questions about workflows or get help |

### Usage

Ali is built into CodeMachine and available by default. Select it from the workflow menu when you run `codemachine`.

## External Workflows

External workflows are community-created packages that extend CodeMachine with new capabilities. Import them using the `import` command.

<Warning>
  External workflows are experimental and may not be stable. They are separate projects from the CodeMachine orchestration platform.
</Warning>

For detailed import instructions, see [Import Workflows](/build-workflows/import-workflows).

## CodeMachine One

<Badge color="yellow">External</Badge> <Badge color="orange">Experimental</Badge>

The first community workflow built for CodeMachine. This workflow serves as a reference implementation and starting point for workflow developers.

### When to Use

- Exploring how external workflows are structured
- Learning workflow development patterns
- Starting point for your own workflow modifications

### Import

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="CLI">
    ```bash
    codemachine import moazbuilds/codemachine-one-codemachine
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="TUI">
    ```
    /import moazbuilds/codemachine-one-codemachine

## BMAD Method

<Badge color="yellow">External</Badge> <Badge color="orange">Experimental</Badge>

A partial adaptation of the BMAD Method for CodeMachine. The original BMAD is an AI-driven agile development framework featuring 21 specialized agents, 50+ guided workflows, and scale-adaptive intelligence—this workflow includes a subset of those capabilities.

### About BMAD

The BMAD Method was created by **BMad Code, LLC** and is designed as a collaborative AI partner that guides developers through structured processes. It uses expert agents (PM, Architect, Developer, UX specialist, Scrum Master, etc.) to enhance human thinking rather than replace it.

### When to Use

- Agile software development projects
- Projects requiring structured planning and architecture
- Teams wanting AI-assisted project management
- Enterprise system development

### Import

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="CLI">
    ```bash
    codemachine import moazbuilds/bmad-codemachine
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="TUI">
    ```
    /import moazbuilds/bmad-codemachine
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Repositories
