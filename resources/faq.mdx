**Common questions about CodeMachine.**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Does CodeMachine store or access my API keys?" icon="key">
    No. CodeMachine wraps CLI commands and passes authentication through to the underlying engines. It never sees, stores, or transmits your API keys.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does CodeMachine collect any data?" icon="database">
    No. CodeMachine runs entirely on your local machine. It does not collect, send, or store any usage data, telemetry, or analytics.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use CodeMachine commercially?" icon="building">
    Yes. CodeMachine is licensed under Apache 2.0—use it for any purpose, including commercial projects.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need an account with an AI coding engine?" icon="user">
    Yes. CodeMachine orchestrates AI coding engines but doesn't provide AI capabilities itself. You need an active subscription or API access to at least one supported engine (Claude Code, Codex, etc.).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I use a different engine or model?" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Configure the engine and model in your template file. Each workflow specifies which engine to use, and you can change this at any time.

  <Accordion title="How do I restart or resume a workflow?" icon="rotate-left">
    Your `template.json` serves as the runtime file and maintains the full execution state. It tracks every step, so you can navigate back to any point or restart from the beginning.
