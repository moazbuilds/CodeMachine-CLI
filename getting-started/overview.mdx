## What CodeMachine Does For You

- **Build Once, Run Forever:** Define complex workflows once and execute them reliably on every project. Stop rebuilding the same patterns manually.
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration:** Assign different coding agents to different tasks.
- **Parallel Execution:** Run multiple agents simultaneously on different parts of your workflow for faster results.
- **Long-Running Workflows:** Execute workflows for hours or days. CodeMachine handles persistence so you don't have to babysit.
- **Context Engineering:** Centralize prompts, manage dynamic context, and control what each agent sees at each step.
