## Get Started in 30 Seconds

Prerequisites:

- One working AI engine CLI configured (Codex, Claude Code, OpenCode, or others). See supported engines →

```bash
npm install -g codemachine # or bun/pnpm/yarn
```

### Start using CodeMachine:

```bash
cd your-project
codemachine # or cm
```

### Authenticate Your Engines:

Use `/login `to authenticate one or more AI engines.

<Note>
  Note: Each workflow specifies which engine(s) it uses. You can override this in the workflow file if needed. Check the workflow's requirements before running.
</Note>

### Choose A workflow:

Use `/templates` to browse workflows. The default is ali.workflow - a built-in workflow builder to help you create your first workflow. If you have imported templates they will also appear here. Explore the workflows library →

## What CodeMachine Does For You

- **Build Once, Run Forever:** Define complex workflows once and execute them reliably on every project. Stop rebuilding the same patterns manually.
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration:** Assign different coding agents to different tasks.
- **Parallel Execution:** Run multiple agents simultaneously on different parts of your workflow for faster results.
- **Long-Running Workflows:** Execute workflows for hours or days. CodeMachine handles persistence so you don't have to babysit.
- **Context Engineering:** Centralize prompts, manage dynamic context, and control what each agent sees at each step.
