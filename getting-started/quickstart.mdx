**Get running in 5 minutes.**

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install CodeMachine">
    ```bash
    npm install -g codemachine
    # or bun/pnpm/yarn
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start CodeMachine">
    ```bash
    codemachine
    # to run codemachine interactive session
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authenticate an Engine">
    ```bash
    /login
    # to authenticate one or more AI engines
    ```

    <Info>
      Each workflow specifies which engine(s) it uses. You can override this in the workflow file if needed. [See supported engines →](#)
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose a Workflow">
    ```bash
    /templates
    # to list all built-in or imported templates
    ```

    <Tip>
      The default workflow is [Ali Workflow](#), a built-in workflow builder to help you create your first workflow. More workflows are available in the library but currently experimental. [Browse workflows →](#)
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run It">
    ```bash
    /start
    # to run the selected workflow
    ```
    Your screen will differ depending on the workflow. You may see onboarding questions, indicating the workflow has [tracks or conditions](#). Once you reach the [workflow screen](#), you're at the main screen where you can monitor all your agents.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
  You're now running your first workflow!
