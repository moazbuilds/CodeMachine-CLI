This quickstart guide will have you running AI-powered workflows in just a few minutes. By the end, you'll know how to authenticate your engines and launch your first workflow.

### Before you begin

- Make sure you have:
  - A terminal or command prompt open
  - A code project to work with

## Step 1: install CodeMachine

```bash
npm install -g codemachine # or bun/pnpm/yarn`
```

## Step 2: Authenticate Your Engines

CodeMachine requires having one working engine when you start an interactive session, you'll need to log in to [one of the supported engines.](#)

```bash
codemachine
# to run codemachine interactive session
```

```bash
/login
# to authenticate one or more AI engines.
```

<Note>
  Note: Each workflow specifies which engine(s) it uses. You can override this in the workflow file if needed. Check the workflow's requirements before running.
</Note>

## Step 3: Choose A workflow

```bash
/templates
# to list all built-in or imported templates.
```

<Note>
  Note: The default workflow is Ali-Workflow, a built-in workflow builder to help you create your first workflow.

  You can import other workflows to try, however, all supported workflows are currently unstable in v0.8 (NOVA). If you still want to use them, [explore the workflow library here →](#)
</Note>

## Step 4: Start Your Workflow

Use  to run the selected workflow.

```bash
/start
# to run the selected workflow.
```

Your screen will differ depending on the workflow. You may see onboarding questions, indicating the workflow has [tracks or conditions](#). Once you reach the [workflow screen](#), you're at the main screen where you can monitor all your agents.
