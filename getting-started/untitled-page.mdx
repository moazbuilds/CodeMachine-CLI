This quickstart guide will have you running AI-powered workflows in just a few minutes. By the end, you'll know how to authenticate your engines and launch your first workflow.

### Before you begin

- Make sure you have:
  - A terminal or command prompt open
  - A code project to work with
  - At least one authenticated engine. See Supported Engines →

### Authenticate Your Engines:

Use `/login `to authenticate one or more AI engines.

<Note>
  Note: Each workflow specifies which engine(s) it uses. You can override this in the workflow file if needed. Check the workflow's requirements before running.
</Note>

### Choose A workflow:

Use `/templates` to browse workflows. The default is ali.workflow - a built-in workflow builder to help you create your first workflow. If you have imported templates they will also appear here. Explore the workflows library →
