## What CodeMachine Does For You

### Build Once, Run Forever

Define complex workflows once and execute them reliably on every project. Stop rebuilding the same patterns manually.

### Multi-Agent Orchestration

Assign different coding agents to different tasks.

### Parallel Execution

Run multiple agents simultaneously on different parts of your workflow for faster results.

### Long-Running Workflows

Execute workflows for hours or days. CodeMachine handles persistence so you don't have to babysit.

### Context Engineering

Centralize prompts, manage dynamic context, and control what each agent sees at each step.
