**A workflow is a configured execution plan.**

It defines which agents run, in what order, with what controls, and how context flows between them.

## What Makes Up a Workflow

Every workflow consists of:

- <Icon icon="tag" /> **Name** - The workflow's display name
- <Icon icon="list-ol" /> **Steps** - The sequence of steps to execute
- <Icon icon="share-nodes" /> **Sub-agents** - Additional agents the workflow can use
- <Icon icon="code-branch" /> **Tracks** - Different workflow paths users can choose from
- <Icon icon="toggle-on" /> **Condition Groups** - Questions to customize which steps run
- <Icon icon="gamepad" /> **Controller** - An agent that guides users before the workflow starts
- <Icon icon="file-lines" /> **Specification** - Whether a spec file is needed before starting
- <Icon icon="robot" /> **Autonomous Mode** - How the workflow runs (auto or manual)

## How Workflows Execute

Workflows run step by step. Each step contains an agent that performs work, produces output, and passes context to the next step.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Onboarding">
    If tracks or conditions are defined, user answers questions to configure the workflow path.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step Execution">
    Each step runs its agent. The agent receives prompts, uses tools, and produces output.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Context Passing">
    Files, outputs, and user choices flow to the next step as placeholders.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Completion">
    All steps finish. Final outputs are available in the project directory.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Workflow vs Agent

| Concept | What It Is | Scope |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| **Workflow** | Execution plan | Orchestrates multiple agents |
| **Agent** | Engine session | Executes a single step |

A workflow coordinates agents. An agent does the actual work.

<Info>
  One workflow can have many agents. One agent belongs to one step.
</Info>

## Import Workflows

Imports are external workflows built by the CodeMachine team or community.

- <Icon icon="globe" /> Shared via external repos
- <Icon icon="box" /> Contains workflows, agents, prompts, and config
- <Icon icon="download" /> Install via TUI or CLI
- <Icon icon="users" /> Anyone can share, anyone can install

<Tip>
  **Built-in workflows** come with the CodeMachine package. **Imports** are installed separately.
</Tip>
