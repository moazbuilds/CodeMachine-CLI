**CodeMachine runs AI workflows in your terminal.**

## The Workflow Model

Every time you use an AI coding agent, you're running a workflow. Fix a bug? You ask questions, reproduce, analyze, plan, implement, test. Build a feature? You research, design, code, review. You've already figured out what works.

The workflow lives in your head. You guide the agent through it, step by step, session by session. It works. But every time you start, you rebuild it from scratch. You re-explain the process. You remember to ask the right questions. You manage when to clear context, when to push forward, when to loop back.

CodeMachine lets you capture that workflow and run it again.

Define the steps once. Choose which agents handle what. Add an agent that always asks the right questions at the start. Chain agents together - one to plan, one to implement, one to review. Control exactly what each agent sees, so they stay focused instead of overwhelmed.

<Tip>
  Your workflows become tools instead of steps in your head. Share them with your team. Run them on every project. Improve them over time.

## The Conceptual Layer

CodeMachine is built on two ideas:

  <Card title="Workflows" icon="diagram-project">
    The structure. What happens, in what order, with what controls. You define this once and reuse it.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Context Management" icon="brain">
    What each agent knows. You control the data, the focus, the specialization. Instead of one agent knowing everything, each agent knows exactly what it needs.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How CodeMachine Runs Engines

CodeMachine is an orchestration layer that runs AI coding CLIs through structured workflows. You define the workflow once, and CodeMachine handles execution, context passing, and agent coordination.

<Accordion title="Technical details" icon="gear" defaultOpen>
  CodeMachine uses the headless or detached scripting mode that AI coding engines provide for automation (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and others). It spawns engines via CLI wrapping, passes the right arguments and flags, and controls agents through its infrastructure.

  This follows each engine's official documentation for scripting and automation use.
