**An agent is a session of an AI coding engine.**

One agent equals one engine session with a unique ID. Each agent has its own engine, model, and configuration.

---

## What Makes Up an Agent

Every agent consists of:

- <Icon icon="microchip" /> **Engine** - The AI coding CLI that powers the agent
- <Icon icon="brain" /> **Model** - The AI model the engine uses
- <Icon icon="hand" /> **Interactivity** - Whether the agent waits for input or runs automatically
- <Icon icon="plug" /> **MCP** - External tools and integrations available to the agent
- <Icon icon="message" /> **Prompts** - The instructions sent to the agent

## Agent Types

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Main Agent" icon="robot">
    Runs as a step in the workflow. Does the primary work.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Module" icon="rotate">
    A main agent that can loop back to earlier steps.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Sub-agent" icon="share-nodes">
    Spawned by main agents via MCP to delegate work.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Controller" icon="gamepad">
    Orchestrates on your behalf - answers questions, signals next steps.
  </Card>

## When to Use Each Type

### Main Agent

Use for standard workflow steps that run once and pass output forward.

<Accordion title="Best for" icon="check" defaultOpen>
  - Single-pass tasks (analysis, generation, implementation)
  - Steps that don't need to revisit previous work
  - Most workflow steps
</Accordion>

### Module

Use when a step needs to loop back based on results.

<Accordion title="Best for" icon="check" defaultOpen>
  - Review and revision cycles
  - Iterative refinement
  - Quality gates that may require rework
</Accordion>

### Sub-agent

Use to break complex work into delegated tasks within a single step.

<Accordion title="Best for" icon="check" defaultOpen>
  - Parallel task execution
  - Context isolation
  - Specialized subtasks
</Accordion>

<Note>
  Sub-agents are not steps. They are a context management tool for delegating work between agents.
</Note>

### Controller

Use for autonomous workflows where you want an agent to make decisions between steps.

<Accordion title="Best for" icon="check" defaultOpen>
  - Long-running autonomous workflows
  - Tasks where you want to review results, not manage process
  - Complex multi-step operations with clear objectives
</Accordion>

## Agent vs Step

| Concept | What It Is |
|---------|-----------|
| **Step** | A position in the workflow sequence |
| **Agent** | The AI session that executes at that position |

Every step has exactly one agent. The step defines when to run. The agent defines how to run.

---

## Engines

An engine is an AI coding CLI that powers the agent. Different engines have different capabilities.

| Engine | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Claude Code | Anthropic's coding CLI |
| Codex | OpenAI's coding CLI |
| Cursor | Cursor's AI assistant |
| Others | Community-supported engines |

Each agent can use a different engine. Mix and match based on task requirements.

### Models

Each engine supports different AI models. The model determines the agent's capabilities, speed, and cost. Configure both engine and model per agent to optimize for your use case.

---

## Interactivity

Interactivity determines whether an agent waits for input or proceeds automatically.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Interactive" icon="hand">
    **Agent waits for user input.**

    - Pauses after each prompt
    - User reviews and responds
    - Best for exploration and Q&A
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Non-Interactive" icon="bolt">
    **Agent proceeds automatically.**

    - No pauses between prompts
    - Runs to completion
    - Best for automated pipelines
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info>
  This is how hybrid workflows work - some agents wait for you, others run automatically.
</Info>

---

## MCP

MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers extend agent capabilities with additional tools.

**What MCP provides:**
- <Icon icon="plug" /> Custom tool integrations
- <Icon icon="database" /> External data access
- <Icon icon="share-nodes" /> Sub-agent spawning
- <Icon icon="bell" /> Signals for workflow control

<Note>
  The signals MCP is required for autonomous workflows where agents need to communicate with the controller.
</Note>

---

## Prompts

Prompts are the instructions sent to an agent. They define what the agent should do.

### Chained Prompts

Multiple prompts injected into the same agent session, one after another. Instead of overwhelming one step with all instructions, you break it into smaller sequential prompts.

**Example flow:**
1. First prompt: "Analyze the codebase structure"
2. User reviews output
3. Second prompt: "Based on your analysis, identify potential issues"
4. User reviews output
5. Third prompt: "Create a plan to address the top 3 issues"

<Info>
  Same agent, same session. Prompts run in sequence. Common in interactive Q&A workflows.
</Info>

### Placeholders

Placeholders inject data into agent prompts.

| Type | Source | Use case |
|------|--------|----------|
| Static (packageDir) | Pre-defined prompts from workflow package | Shared prompts, split large prompts |
| Dynamic (userDir) | Files created during workflow | Agent A outputs a file, Agent B receives it |

<Icon icon="gear" /> **Built-in Placeholders:** System data injected automatically - date, time, username, project name, selected tracks and conditions.

### Directives

Directives allow agents to control the workflow by writing to a JSON file. The workflow listens after each step and takes action.

| Directive | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| `checkpoint` | Shows message to user, option to continue or stop |
| `stop` | Stops the workflow |
| `error` | Shows error message and stops |
| `pause` | Pauses and waits for user input |
| `loop` | Returns back to a previous step (modules only) |
| `trigger` | Triggers any agent in the workflow (modules only) |

<Note>
  Directives come from agents. Signals come from users. Both control execution, but from different sources.
</Note>
